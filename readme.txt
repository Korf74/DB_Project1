4.1 Justifications of data structures
-------------------------------------
'Attribute' is a class containing the attribute name and a way to print it.
'Attributes' is a type used as a simplification for Set[Attribute]

The datastructure used is a class named 'FunctionalDependencies' that handles all functions we need. This class stores internally a Map Attributes -> Attributes.
Maps in Scala are more or less the equivalent of Java's HashMaps, thus having constant time lookup, add, remove which suits our need well in addition of being a good theoretical representation
of Functional dependencies.


4.2 Strategy for Choose A
-------------------------

4.3 Find the bug
The cornercase happens in the case of a functional dependency with an empty left-handside, the result should be the schema but the algorithm will yield the empty set.

There is a problems as well if the implementation is not done with sets and the left-handside contains doublons, e.g. AA -> B, which will not yield a correct result. Since sets do not have duplicates, a correct implementation should not make this case arise.

 --------------------------

6.1 Interestingness of generate
With sets given by generate, Algorithm 2 works much more efficiently (linear time) than Algorithm 1 (not in linear time).

Explanation:
With Algorithm 2: each dependency is read only exactly once that it is checked at line 9.
However, when using Algorithm 1, a dependency could be read many times. Let's consider the For loop at line 5, it checks every functional dependency whose left hand side in is Closure but there is only one of them that satisfies the condition at line 6

Counter-example: case n=3, 
	Functional dependencies: 0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3. Find  Cl(0)

	Algorithm 2: closure = 0, update = 0
			While loop: 1. choose 0, update = empty,
				       For loop: count[0 -> 1] = 0; update = 1, closure = {0, 1}
				    2. choose 1, update = empty,
				       For loop: count[1 -> 2] = 0; update = 2, closure = {0, 1, 2}
  				    3. choose 2, update = empty,
				       For loop: count[2 -> 3] = 0; update = 3, closure = {0, 1, 2, 3}
                       
	Algorithm 1: Cl = 0, 
		       While loop:  1. check all dependencies, 0 -> 1 satisfies line 6, Cl = {0, 1}
				    2. check all dependencies, 1 -> 2 satisfies line 6, Cl = {0, 1, 2}
				    3. check all dependencies, 2 -> 3 satisfies line 6, Cl = {0, 1, 2, 3}

In addition, an interesting fact is that functional dependencies generated like this are already normalized.


-------------------------------

6.2 Setup and methodology
-------------------------
The library used for performance comparison is called ScalaMeter (http://scalameter.github.io/)

The benchmarks are configured to test the two algorithms for functional dependencies generated between 0 and 3000, with an step of 5 each time.
The library uses a 'warmup' that permits to detect steady-states in the JVM garbage collector, once done it tests X times on each input where X is given (here 36, by default).
The outliers are suppressed automatically and the output uses the mean and variance of each test. The test can be more precise but I chose to stay simple.



6.3 Analysis
------------
The output of the benchmark can be seen in target/benchmarks/report/index.html, ScalaMeter generates an html file containing all needed information.
The output takes the form of a simple graph but you can look at its histogram form. You can choose to see only the input you want.
You can chose to show standard deviation.

What we can see from these datas is quite clear, at first Algorithm 1 is better (for little values), but as the input size grows there is a clear tendancy for it to be non-linear while the second Algorithm is almost linear.
